# Tera_EDA_challenge
First EDA and  statistical inference using T-Test ( or A/B test) ,  Qui-Squared Test and F-Test

In this challenge I try to discoer which features affect the depresseion level. For this, real data from Healthy Eating Index (HEI),  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used, this last one used for measure depression's level on patients.
